title: Tanja Šarčević
subtitle: PhD candidate @ TU Wien | Researcher @ SBA Research
---

I am a PhD student at [Doctoral School at TU Wien Informatics](https://www.tuwien.at/) advised by [Andreas Rauber](http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~andi/). In my dissertation, I focus on novel approaches for ownership verification of tabular data that diminish the negative effects on different aspects of data utility.
Currently, I am a researcher in [SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/) in the [Machine Learning and Data Management Group](https://www.sba-research.org/research/mldm/) group where I work on projects in the areas of data privacy, ownership verification and ML privacy & security.

I previously completed master studies [Logic and Computation](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/logic-and-computation/) at TU Wien, and the bachelor program in [Computer Science](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/studiji/fer3/racunarstvo) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at Zagreb University.
I have been tutoring and teaching at TU Wien and FH Technikum in courses _Machine Learning_ and _Security and Privacy in Machine Learning_.

__I am passionate about Machine Learning and, in particular, how to make it secure, safe and privacy-aware.__

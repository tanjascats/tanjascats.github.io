I am a PhD student at <a href:="https://www.tuwien.at/">Doctoral School at TU Wien Informatics</a> advised by <a href="http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~andi/">Andreas Rauber</a>. In my dissertation, I focus on novel approaches for ownership verification of tabular data that diminish the negative effects on different aspects of data utility.
Currently, I am a researcher in <a href="https://www.sba-research.org/">SBA Research</a> in the <a href="https://www.sba-research.org/research/mldm/">Machine Learning and Data Management</a> group where I work on projects in the areas of data privacy, ownership verification and ML privacy & security.

I previously completed master studies Logic and Computation at TU Wien, and the bachelor program in Computer Science at the Faculty of Computing and Electrical Engineering at Zagreb University.
I am passionate about Machine Learning and, in particular, how to make it secure, safe and privacy-aware.
